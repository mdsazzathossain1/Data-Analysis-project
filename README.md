# Data-Analysis-project
Explores and fixes missing data in a dataset. Visualizes missingness with missingno and seaborn heatmaps, then applies imputation strategies: mean fillna, forward fill (ffill), backward fill (bfill), and linear interpolation. Saves a cleaned dataset.
A practical missing-data diagnostics and repair pipeline that you can apply to any numeric dataset: it reads a CSV from data/df_with_missing.csv (adjust the path as needed), summarizes missingness with df.isna().sum(), visualizes patterns via missingno.matrix and a seaborn heatmap (great for spotting column-wise or block-wise gaps), then demonstrates multiple imputation strategies — mean imputation with fillna, forward/backward propagation (ffill/bfill) for series with local continuity, and continuous linear interpolation (or method="time" if the index is a DatetimeIndex) — before exporting a cleaned version (e.g., data/df_interpolated.csv) for downstream modeling. The single file gives you both the visual evidence to choose an approach and code paths to try alternatives quickly; you can easily adapt it to group-wise imputation (e.g., by category) or to more advanced methods later. Dependencies include numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, missingno, scipy, and scikit-learn.
